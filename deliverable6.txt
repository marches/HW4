The << operator shifts the LHS by the number of bits on the RHS. 

If enable is 1'b1 and address is (20)_10 (represented in binary, of course), then 1 << (20)_10 will result in out = (20)_10 = 10100 (represented in 32 bits, so zero padded on the RHS). 

I assume that because out is 32 bits, enable is zero padded in some way, otherwise the << operator would mostly just result in out being set to 0.
